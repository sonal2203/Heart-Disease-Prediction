# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters using machine learning. It integrates a trained ML model with a user-friendly web interface built using Flask, Google Colab, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to input their health data and receive predictions.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Preprocessing: Combines two datasets (1328 records) for better training.

✅ Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.

✅ Web Interface: Interactive form for user input with real-time prediction display.

✅ Flask Backend: Handles model inference and serves the web application.

📊 Dataset

Dataset 1: 303 records

Dataset 2: 1025 records

Total Combined: 1328 records

Features include age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, and more.

🔍 Model Training
